    "## Scenario\n",
    "You're getting ready for your first flying lesson! The only thing is... you're too scared. You know that the airfield uses a machine learning model to predict the wind speed and that if the winds are too high, no one can fly. You hacked onto one of four sensors (index 1): the sensor that measures the maximum temperature (in celsius). The other sensors are rain (in mm, index 0), minimum temperature (in censius, index 2), and grass temperature (in celsius, index 3). Can you get class canceled for the day?\n",
